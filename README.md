# Odin Recipes

Welcome to my Odin Recipes project repository! This project was my first coding endeavor, and it served as an excellent introduction to HTML and web development. I embarked on this project as part of my learning journey with "The Odin Project" 2 years ago, before I even knew how to write in MarkDown!

## About "The Odin Project"

"The Odin Project" is a comprehensive curriculum that provides self-paced, open-source learning materials for individuals interested in mastering web development. It covers a wide range of topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, guiding learners through hands-on projects and practical exercises.

## My Experience with Odin Recipes

As a beginner, I decided to tackle the Odin Recipes project to practice my HTML skills and create a simple yet functional webpage. The main goal was to display a collection of recipes using HTML markup. I used semantic tags to structure the content, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. By following the guidelines provided by "The Odin Project," I gained a solid understanding of HTML fundamentals.

## Repository Structure

Within this repository, you will find an HTML file named `index.html` that serves as the main page for the Odin Recipes project. It contains a list of recipes, each represented by a clickable link. Clicking on a recipe will take you to a dedicated page where you can find the detailed instructions for that particular dish.

## Getting Started with Odin Recipes

To get started and explore the recipes, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. From there, you can navigate through the recipes by clicking on the provided links.

## Conclusion

Embarking on the Odin Recipes project using the resources and guidance from "The Odin Project" was an invaluable experience. It not only taught me the basics of HTML but also instilled in me the importance of hands-on practice and building real projects. I'm proud to share this repository as a testament to my growth as a web developer.
