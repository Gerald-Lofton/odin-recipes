    <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
    <p>
      This mouthwatering meal combines the comfort of a grilled cheese sandwich
      with the deliciousness of a cheeseburger into a juicy, satisfying patty
      melt.
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Montreal-style steak seasoning</li>
      <li>6 slices white bread</li>
      <li>6 slices Colby-Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Directions</strong></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine ground beef, parsley, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and steak
        seasoning in a bowl; mix until thoroughly combined. Form into 3
        evenly-sized patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm a nonstick griddle over medium heat. Place burgers onto the warm
        griddle and cook to desired doneness, 4 to 6 minutes per side. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Remove burgers and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm a second griddle over medium heat. Butter 1 side of each bread
        slice. Place a slice of bread onto the griddle, butter-side down. Add a
        slice of cheese, a burger, and a second slice of cheese. Top with
        another slice of bread, butter-side up. Repeat with remaining burgers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until bread is golden brown on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip and
        cook until the other side is golden brown and cheese is melted, 3 to 5
        minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
