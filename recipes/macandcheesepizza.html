    <h4><strong>Description</strong></h4>
    <p>
      Do you like macaroni and cheese? Do you like pizza? Then what better meal
      to make than combining them both to make a cheesy delicious meal!
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Ingredients</strong></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crust</li>
      <li>¾ cup cavatappi (corkscrew macaroni)</li>
      <li>
        ⅔ (16 ounce) jar cheese sauce (such as Ragu® Double Cheddar), divided,
        or as needed
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>Directions</strong></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place pizza crust on a
        baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook cavatappi in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm
        to the bite, 10 to 11 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir 1/2 the cheese sauce and butter into the cavatappi pot over medium
        heat until butter is melted and pasta-cheese mixture is combined. Season
        with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of cheese sauce over the pizza crust. Sprinkle
        shredded Cheddar cheese over the cheese sauce onto the crust. Pour
        pasta-cheese mixture over the Cheddar cheese, and top with another 1/2
        the cheese sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pizza in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, 8 to 10
        minutes. Let rest for 2 minutes before slicing.
      </li>
